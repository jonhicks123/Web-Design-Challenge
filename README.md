# Web-Design-Challenge

For this challenge, I created a website using html, css, and bootstrap. The website is based on a project I completed on weather analyses using OpenWeatherMap's API, and all plots used in this website are paired with their respective analyses. The data used for the initial analyses is located under the data tab.
